# ROBLOX-Studio-Tutorials
This contains the source code for scripts from my [ROBLOX Studio Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLib8lkKsQ4i4Ik77nxD78NfMoeUoS_9w7) on the [Asians FTW](https://www.youtube.com/AsiansFTW) YouTube Channel, in addition to tutorial setup models that can be imported into ROBLOX Studio.

This repository will be updated semi-regularly (around the release of each tutorial).

After opening up one of the subfolders, you'll be presented with folders that have the name of a tutorial. These will contain source code/model download files related to that tutorial when applicable.
