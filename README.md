# Roblox-Studio-Tutorials
This contains the source code for scripts from the [Roblox Studio Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLib8lkKsQ4i4Ik77nxD78NfMoeUoS_9w7) (and soon other development-related content) on the [Emancyphur](https://www.youtube.com/Emancyphur) YouTube Channel, in addition to tutorial setup models that can be imported into Roblox Studio.

This repository will be updated semi-regularly (around the release of each tutorial).

## Navigation

In order to find what you need, open up one of the folders above. The "Roblox Studio Tutorial Series" folder is for all tutorials from [this playlist of the same name](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLib8lkKsQ4i4Ik77nxD78NfMoeUoS_9w7). The folders are categorized by Episode number -- the folder "Episodes 1-100" will have subfolders that contain resources from Episodes 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc.

After opening up one of the subfolders, you'll be presented with folders that have the name of a tutorial. These will contain source code/model download files related to that tutorial when applicable. In order to import the model into Roblox Studio (optional), right click in the Explorer, click on "Insert From File", then select and open the rbxm file.
