# ROBLOX-Studio-Tutorials
This contains the source code for every script from my [ROBLOX Studio Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLib8lkKsQ4i4Ik77nxD78NfMoeUoS_9w7) on the [Asians FTW](https://www.youtube.com/AsiansFTW) YouTube Channel in addition to a tutorial setup model that can be imported into ROBLOX Studio.

This repository will be updated semi-regularly (around the release of each tutorial).

## Navigation

In order to find what you need, open up one of the folders above. They're categorized by Episode number -- the folder "Episodes 1-100" will have subfolders that contain resources for Episodes 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc.

After opening up one of those folders, you can find another folder with the name of the tutorial and any source code/model download files when applicable.
