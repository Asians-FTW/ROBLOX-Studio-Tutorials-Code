--[[ NOTE: It is highly recommended to import the model file so that any objects that are necessary for the Practice Problems are already created and can simply be moved to the intended place in the game.
These instructions along with the organized Practice Problems and related objects can be found in the: "Scripting Solutions Episode 1 - Practice Problems" rbxm file.

If you prefer to view the Practice Problems directly on GitHub, I've included each one in the folder where these Instructions are located.
Specific instructions for manually setting up the Practice Problems (without importing the model file) are included at the beginning of each lua file.

--[[ Instructions:

Before starting, make sure the "Explorer", "Properties", and "Output" windows are enabled via the "View" tab at the top left of the screen so it becomes easier to solve the Practice Problems.


1. Open the folder named "Practice Problem Scripts".
This contains 5 different Practice Problems that revolve around solving the "X is not a valid member of Y" error message.
Note: It is recommended to complete these Practice Problems in an empty game so that it becomes easier to know what errors are coming from the Practice Problems.

2. To set up a Practice Problem, open one of the "Practice Problem #" folders.

3. Inside of each Practice Problem folder are more folders (sorry) that tell you where different objects should be placed for the Practice Problem to work.

4. As an example, when you open up the "Practice Problem #1" folder, there are two folders inside:
	"For ReplicatedStorage" -- Move any items inside of this folder into the ReplicatedStorage Service
	"For ServerScriptService" -- Move any items inside of this folder into the ServerScriptService Service
	(Do not move the folder itself. Only the items inside of the folder should be moved)

5. Then, enable the script for the Practice Problem by left clicking it once, looking at the "Properties" window, and turning on the "Enabled" property so the code will be able to run when you playtest the game.

6. Now, the Practice Problem is ready to be solved!
To see the first error of the Practice Problem, playtest the game via the "Play" or "Play Here" buttons through the "Test" tab at the top left of the screen.

7. The error(s) should appear in the Output window. When you are ready to edit the script to try to solve the error, click the "Stop" button through the "Test" tab at the top left of the screen so that the changes to the script will save.

8. When you are ready to see if you solved the error(s), repeat step #6 (playtesting the game) to see what appears in the Output.

9. If the error(s) weren't fixed, repeat steps 7 and 8.

10. When you have solved all of the errors in a Practice Problem, the Output should say:
	"Success!"
	"You've solved Practice Problem #"

11. If you are done with a Practice Problem, make sure to disable the script by left clicking it once, looking at the "Properties" window, and turning off the "Enabled" property so its code wont run anymore.
Then, feel free to move any of the objects related to the Practice Problem back into the folder, or just delete it if you don't mind.

12. Repeat steps 2 through 11 for each Practice Problem that you want to try to solve.


Thank you for trying out the Practice Problems.
