------ Non-Commented Version ------


local Players = game:GetService("Players")

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
	player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function(Character)
		
		local ScriptCheck = Character:FindFirstChild("Health")
		
		if ScriptCheck and ScriptCheck:IsA("Script") then
			ScriptCheck:Destroy()
		end
	end)
end)


------ Commented Version ------
-- Place this script into the "ServerScriptService"

local Players = game:GetService("Players") -- References the Players service

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player) -- Activates a function whenever someone joins the game -- the player that joined can be referenced by "player"
	player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function(Character) -- Activates a function whenever a player's Character respawns -- the Character that respawned can be referenced by "Character"
		
		local ScriptCheck = Character:FindFirstChild("Health") -- Creates a varible that will look through the Character for something called "Health"
		
		if ScriptCheck and ScriptCheck:IsA("Script") then -- If the script finds something called "Health" inside of the Character and the item is a script, then...
			ScriptCheck:Destroy() -- The "Health" script will be destroyed
		end -- Ends the "if ScriptCheck and "ScriptCheck:IsA("Script")" then statement
	end) -- Ends CharacterAdded function
end) -- Ends PlayerAdded function
